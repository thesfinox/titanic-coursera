# Survival Probability on Board the Titanic

This repository contains the code used in the final assignment of the "Data Science Specialisation" on Coursera.org offered by the John Hopkins University.

## Description and Methodology

The goal of the assignment is the creation of a Shiny app using RStudio. My choice fell on the prediction of the survival probability on board the famous ship Titanic.

The dataset I used is the usual Titanic dataset used in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). I then simplified the possible input to age, sex and ticket class of the passengers and fit a logistic regression model to have quick predictions on the probability of survival.
